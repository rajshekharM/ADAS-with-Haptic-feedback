# ADAS with Multi-modal and Haptic-feedback
Multi-modal feedback for driver assisted systems in Autonomous driving

This work claims of setting up an immersive, responsive vehicle driving system and mechanism for a
driving assist technology for expanding the sensory horizon of humans while driving and is motivated by
absence of any such system in real world. The system can control and direct an assembly of electronic devices
in real time, using an image acquisition subsystem, an object-recognition and tracking algorithm and a haptic
modeling subsystem working in-tandem with the user. 

The object tracking subsystem operates in real time to determine the current position of a vehicle in front by using a camera and continuously updates it in a live video feed, while also identifying and tracking the moving or stationary vehicle. 

The haptic system, which is integrated with the tracking system, has been programmed to warn the driver of the potential threats that moving/stationary vehicles may generate. All the subsystems are updated and synchronized with each other in real-time to produce a seamless and smooth transition between frames, facilitating a precise and immersive driving experience for anyone. The high accuracy and robustness of the proposed system makes it a versatile component, which can be integrated in variety of applications for enhancing a personâ€™s reality perception.
